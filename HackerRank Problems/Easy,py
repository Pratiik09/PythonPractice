# Example usage of *args Array

name, *line = input().split()    # Takes a input like Pratik 20 30 40 and assign Pratik to name and rest to line list (all as strings)
scores = list(map(float, line))   # Cast all elements of line list to float and generate a list named scores

# Simple Example
# Code
a, *arr1 = [1,2,3,4]
print(arr1)

# Output
[2, 3, 4]
